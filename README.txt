This project is just a hello world type program, at the moment it's mostly the example codes provided by the libraries I'm using. IANAP I just like to pretend like one. Stuff in here will be oddly formed and probably not up to standards, but I'm hoping it'll limp along alright.

That's the disclaimer out of the way.

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
Currently called HelloWorld /* 28/07/2015 */ it'll be renamed to somethng more appropriate once it shows signs of becoming something. 

I'm currently using a DHT-11 sensor and a combo of Arduino Uno and an LCD / toucscreen shield that's sold on Banggood.com (who BTW are a great source of parts, cheap enough and NO POSTAGE) for around $16AUD. The eventual aim is to add a rain sensor, anemometer, and something other than async serial to connect back to a PC for logging, meanwhile using the SD card included in the shield as a logging recorder. 

For a start, is anyone after a $25 digital thermometer with a shiny screen? %) Cos that's all this is going to be for a while. 

Later, I may drop the LCD in favour of all remote commands via whatever transport medium I choose, but I think an SD shield should work directly without modifying more than maybe a read pin or something.
