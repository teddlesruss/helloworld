{"name":"Helloworld","tagline":"Weather Station with and w/o LCD screen. ","body":"# Hello World Weather Station  \r\nThis is my first serious Arduino project, and I wanted to make something that I kinda really need for my homesteading projects. So I'm starting small (it's a $20 digital thermometer with humidity and an LCD screen to tizzy it up) but there's an eventual aim of making it much more capable, and also capable of being part of a network of monitoring stations for all sorts of other things.  \r\n\r\n## Milestone Reached  29/07/15\r\nThe first milestone has been the actual reading data from the sensor and printing that to the LCD, that's now behind me, I have the gifs to prove it! \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
